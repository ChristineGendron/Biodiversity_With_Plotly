# Biodiversity_With_Plotly

This repository provides code for a website visualizing data collected in a study on types of bacteria found in belly buttons. The site allows you to filter data by test subject ID and generates three charts for each ID:

- A horizontal bar chart showing the top 10 bacteria cultures for the selected subject

- A gauge chart showing the average number of times the subject washes their belly button per week

- A bubble chart that allows you to view the name of each bacteria type found on the subject when you hover over a bubble
